# JSON Manager

JSON Manager is a small application which allows to create JSON files in your browser localStorage. It can then export those files in the localStorage for portability and then reimport this file elsewhere merging your existing data.

## A word on the stored data

Each "file" is represented as a JSON encoded string in the localStorage identified by a UUID (v4) key. As a result a generated export of your data should look similar to the following:

```json
{
  "4712a751-4174-4327-8ea0-1970d28b8bd9": { "name": "yadda yadda yadda", "content": "{ \"key\": \"value\", \"int\": 6 }" },
  "e23c3acf-b7f4-4685-a62d-7645e258f072": { "name": "yajf", "content": "{ \"yolo\": \"yala\", \"float\": 5.4 }" }
}
```

## ToDo

* Allow exported data to be imported.
