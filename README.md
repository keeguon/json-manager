# JSON Manager

JSON Manager is a small application which allows to create JSON files in your browser localStorage. It can then export those files in the localStorage for portability and then reimport this file elsewhere merging your existing data.

## Dev requirements

* node
* yarn
* webpack

## Run in development

```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn watch
```

## Build for production

```sh
$ yarn build
```

## Run it in production

Simply open the file `dist/index.html` in your browser.

## A word on the stored data

Each "file" is represented as a JSON encoded string in the localStorage identified by a UUID (v4) key. As a result a generated export of your data should look similar to the following:

```json
{
  "c78d311f-978f-440e-9beb-187e723107c9": { "name": "test", "content": "[1, 2, 3]" },
  "4c2734f7-00bc-476d-ae7f-e5e787d363d6": { "name": "yadda", "content": "{\"key\":\"value\",\"int\":6}" }
}
```

## Standalone application (in progress)

I started playing with electron in order to deliver the application as a standalone package on different platforms, for the moment there's no build script available. However, if you want to test the app in standalone mode, build the app for production and then run:

```sh
yarn start
```

The standalone version run a static file server to serve the builded app, depending on your OS firewall it might ask to allow the creation of said server.

## ToDo

* Optimize production build
* Create standalone package for different platforms
